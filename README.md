# Analyzing-Job-Market-Data ðŸ“Š
## Scope :page_with_curl:
This report is focused on exploring a real-world job posting dataset to uncover insights for a fictional recruitment company.

I used visualization techniques to investigate the data to find out what skills are most in-demand for data scientists, data analysts, and data engineers.

Useful insights were obtained.
## Data Design :bar_chart:
The raw data provided were downloaded in CSV file formats and it came with some of its contents being improperly formatted hence, a proper data cleaning had to be done.
## Import and Transform Data :scroll:
After downloading the data which was in CSV file format, I imported the data into Tableau being the tool Iâ€™ll be using for analysis and visualization.

##
Now, you see below, All columns in the dataset are loaded.

Tableau recognized the "Job posting ID" field as a "Measure" instead of a "Dimension", I changed it to be a "Dimension".

## Data Cleaning/Check :shower:
For any analysis, missing values can have a huge impact.
I investigate whether the "Minimum Pay" column has any missing values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ðŸ“Š
I created a bar chart showing the total number of job applicants per company industry.

Then I checked for how many distinct values there are in "Company Industires".

Finally, I sorted the bar chart by Total Number of Applicants per Industry.

##
To have an understanding of the relationship between "Years of Experience' and "Job Position Level", I created a Column chart.
But I changed the Measure from "Sum" to "Average".

##
I sorted the "Average Years of Experience" in Ascending Order.

##
I used the "Job postings date" column to visualize the distinct number of postings per month, and used "Job Position Level" to differentiate these Job Postings.

##
I created a calculated field called "Average Pay" which calculates the average salary using "Minimum Pay" and "Maximum Pay".

##
**KEY INSIGHT**
(1) As years of experience increase for a job, so does the associated salary.

(2) There are many empty values for salary inforamtion from postings.

(3) Job postings over the last 5 years are tranding upwards.
